# Software Supply Chain Security

## Introduction
A knowledge base comprising **Software Supply Chain Security** initiatives, standards, regulations, organizations, vendors, tooling, books, articles and a plethora of other learning resources from the web. The list was initially compiled to help me with my research on the topic of Software Supply Chain Security. I've now made the list public for the benefit of everyone else working in this domain. I will endeavour to keep the list up to date as best as I can.
